        question: 'Who does the Press AttackTracker count as a journalist?',
        answer: "The Press Attack Tracker adopts a functional definition of who  a journalist is. It doesn’t matter whether the individual has a press pass or went to journalism school, whether they work for the print, broadcast, multimedia, online or freelance. What matters is that the person was performing an act of journalism. The tracker will count journalists whose rights to gather and disseminate information were violated in the course of their work or as a result of their work. While we recognize the importance and the rights of private citizens who snap a photo or video of an arrest, this site will only cover individuals who self-identify as journalists and have some track record of journalistic work."
